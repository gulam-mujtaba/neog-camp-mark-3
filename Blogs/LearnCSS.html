     <P>
        Ever wondered why every other website that you see on the internet looks different or feels different even though they might have the same function?  Well now you know it's CSS which stands for <i>Cascading Style Sheets.</i>
</P>
     <p>
        CSS is a language of design for your website. It makes your website or web application stand out of the crowd. It makes your website look unique and special.
        There is so much you can do with CSS that learning never ends.</p>
        <p>
            Today I'm going to share some of my learnings and clear your doubts with some CSS functions.
            </p>

            <b><h3>1. Padding and Margin:</h3></b>

        <p>Lot of people get confused with these two terms, let me explain to you in simple words.</p>

        <p><b>Padding is the area between the edge of your content and the border.</b></p>
        <p>Padding is used to give content some air to breath or you can say to ease readability of your content.</p>
        <p>Margin on the other hand is the <b>space between two components of a website.</b></p>
        <p>Margin is used to create space around elements, it comes outside of the border of an element/content and it is transparent.</p>
        <p>Margins are recommended for better user experience to the end user. Just like you don't want your clothes in your Almirah to be cluttered, margin helps in creating spaces between the elements so your website is not cluttered.</p>
        <b><h3>2. Outline and Border:</h3></b>
        <p>Another area where most people get confused is Outline and Border.</p>
        <p>Let's understand Border first. <b>A border let's user give or set a border for the element.</b> You can choose to give a different color, width or style to an element.</p>
        <p>Whereas the <b>Outline is a line drawn around elements outside the border of an element</b>.</p>

        <p>One thing to note here is that outlines are not a part of elements dimension and may overlap with other elements.</p>
        <p>Now you know it all. I hope you have got s clear about what is a border, outline, padding and Margin and the difference between them.</p>
        <p>Now go and apply this knowledge and try it out yourself.</p>
        <p>As always, Web development is Fun!
        </p>
