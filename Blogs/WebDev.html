        My journey into Web Development

     <P>
        Hi, So today I am here to share my journey with you on how I started my web development journey.<br>



        Since childhood I have been fascinated by technology and the world around it. I always loved to read blogs on new age technology, gadgets, computers and smartphones.<br><br>


        The craze I had for smartphones, especially OMG, you won't believe it, every smartphone, every new technology around it and what not. I just wanted to buy every new smartphone as soon as it launched but  I could not, well you know (no money ðŸ¤‘)<br><br>


        Then my interest towards computer technology was growing and slowly but steadily it shifted to web technologies.<br><br>


        I then was so obsessed with new developments in the industry and seeing some interesting stories on how people from different background,  age groups and regions are learning these technologies and we'll making a lot of cash.ðŸ˜œ<br><br>


        But but but, it was not easy, there is a lot of content out there, a lot of courses, hence a lot of confusion.<br><br>


        Luckily I found someone in instagram stories who was regularly posting stories about new projects and their developments and progress into learning Web Development. I knew that he was not from a technical background. I wondered how he learned all of it and made these fun projects.<br><br>


        I DM'd him right away and he said just 2 words. Well, you know them right, <b>"neog camp".</b>


        At that time I was having my exams and seats were filling out fast for the camp. I couldn't make it back then but decided to give my best to get into the next cohort.<br><br>


        And here I'm writing blogs for mark 15 and hoping to get into level 1 of the 2022 cohort.<br><br>


        I hope you have enjoyed reading about my journey and inspire you to take action on whatever you plan to do in your life.<br><br>


        I would like to close here with one of  my favourite quote <b>"NEVER GIVE UP".</b><br><br>



        If you are new here, then I would like you to check out my projects (some of them are really cool) and my other blogs as well.
